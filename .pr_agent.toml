- Grammar and spelling errors
- Delete commented code
- Unclear or ambiguous comments
- Comments that require other comments to understand
- Maintain only brief, precise, and professional comments
- Organize test code into modular, maintainable components
- Use Page Object Model (POM) for UI automation
- API Object Model (AOM) which follows a similar principle to POM by encapsulating API request logic into reusable objects
- Store secrets in environment variables. Donâ€™t add environment files (i.e. .env) in git commits to avoid leaking secrets
- Use configuration files for values that may change between environments.
- Move test data to static files
- Implement robust error handling mechanisms to catch and log unexpected failures without causing false negatives
- Parameterize tests to support multiple input values and improve coverage. 
- Do not duplicate tests
- Tests should not be inter-dependent. To promote code reusability, prefer separating common functionality in its own scope
